Technical Discussion with Shilpa(Ph.D Project)

1. Every phase we considered must have a proper output to be submitted.
2. Once the output is verified, next phase work can be scheduled.
3. A sentiment analysis shall be included at last of the whole work.
4. She also needs support for research paper preparation(i.e, paper work) and she was informed that it can be partially done.
5. Two major things, one is Article layout segmentation and News topic classification(Sports, Politics, Entertainment, etc).


Realization:
1. High computations are required to implement both of the above requirements.
2. Our model/algorithm we develop must include improvements ahead of previous other work. So, a strong literature survey must be done.

Project Requirements:
1. For phase 2, we require 1 or 2 interns to work dedicately for two different model developments
2. As it involves Machine Learning/Deep Learning (ML/DL) model developments, we need real-time GPU integrated systems
3. Needed a strong and complete training on AI/ML/DL real-time developements for our team
